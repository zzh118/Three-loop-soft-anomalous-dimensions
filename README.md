# Three-loop-soft-anomalous-dimensions
This includes the results of all quadrupole terms contributing to the one-mass soft anomalous dimension at three loops. 
# Usage
To run the Mathematica notebook "ThreeLoopSoftAnomalousDimenaions.nb", the package "PolyLogTools"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07279) should be installed. Please put the file "StraightF13.mx" and "FibrationBases.mx" in the same directory as that of the notebook.
